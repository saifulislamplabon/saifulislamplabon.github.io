    <h2>Seriously, it is very hard to find stuff to write on your personal website.</h2>
    <p><strong>7 things to know about me</strong></p>
    <p>I have many more, but this template requires seven!</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>But above all, I love plants</h3>
    <p>I love plants so much, that I can not breathe without them (literally).</p>
    
    <h2>Tech Enthusiast</h2>
    <p>I am a hardcore tech enthusiast. I am fascinated by how much and how fast our surroundings changed after the revolution of the personal computer.</p>

    <h2>Linux Enthusiast</h2>
    <p>Why would you use any other operating system rather than linux! It's secure, easy to use and free for all!</p>
    <p>After years of distro hopping, finally landed on fedora and don't feel the need to switch!</p>

    <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>I make forms using spring, java and hibernate for living. I work with java, love c and jealous of python.</p>
   
    <h3>No, This is not a satire</h3>
    <p>I loved what the creator of <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site</a> did, and decided to make a serious website using those philosophies.
    Why make one from scratch!
